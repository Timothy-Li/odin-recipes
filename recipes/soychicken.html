    <li>120g finely diced spring onions</li>
    <li>2 tsp grated ginger</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground white pepper</li>
    <li>105g vegetable oil</li>

  <h4>Steamed Jasmine Rice to Serve</h4>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>PREPARE THE CHICKEN: In a pot, combine spring onion, ginger, star anise, soy sauce, chicken powder, msg, water, dark soy sauce, shaoxing wine, rock sugar, oyster sauce, mushroom powder, smoked paprika and black pepper. Bring to a simmer to cook for 5 min, then allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken and the soy sauce-mixture inside a large zip-lock bag, and rub until coated evenly. Transfer to the fridge to marinate overnight (recommended), or at least 4 hours. Turn the chicken once in a while, and remove from the fridge 2 hours before cooking.</li>
    <li>PREPARE GINGER SPRING ONION OIL: Place diced spring onion, grated ginger, salt and ground white pepper in a large bowl. Heat vegetable oil in a pot over high heat until it just starts to smoke a little, then pour it evenly over the mixture. Stir the mixture evenly with a spoon while hot, then let rest for at least 2 hours before using.</li>
    <li>TO COOK THE CHICKEN: Preheat the oven on 300 F/150 C. Choose a pot that will fit the chicken neatly without too much empty space. Remove the chicken from the zip-lock bag, then transfer the marinate into the pot. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat, then add the chicken inside. After turning it once or twice to be coated, transfer the pot inside the oven, uncovered. Every 15 min, come back to it and turn the chicken, basting/brushing the sauce evenly over every surface, then return the pot back in the oven. The chicken will be perfectly done with a beautiful sheen after about 55 to 60 min, until the internal temperature around inner thighs reaches 172 F/ 77 C.</li>
    <li>After the chicken's cooked, hang it either by kitchen-twines around its wings or with meat-hooks, then brush the skin thinly with vegetable oil. Let it cool down to room-temperature. Strain the sauce, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as you can, then discard the solids. Add 2-3 tbsp water to adjust saltiness, set aside.</li>
    <li>Servce chicken at room temperature, cut the chicken in small pieces and place over steamed jasmine rice. Ladle everything with the sauce and a good dollop of ginger and spring onion oil. Sprinkle with ground white pepper.</li>
