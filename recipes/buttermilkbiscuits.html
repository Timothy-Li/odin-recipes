  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Buttermilk biscuits, with golden brown tops, soft in the middle and a county of buttery, flaky layers.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>438g plain flour</li>
    <li>2.5 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)</li>
    <li>227g chilled, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, plus more for brushing</li>
    <li>242g chilled buttermilk</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Preheat oven to 215 C. Line a large baking sheet with greaseproof paper</li>
  <li>Pulse the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and baking soda in a food processor to combine. Add the butter and pulse until largest pieces of butter are the size of a pea. Transfer to a large bowl and gradually drizzle the chilled buttermilk over the dry ingredients, tossing with a fork as you go to incorporate. Knead the mixture a few times the bowl until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a clean surface and pat into a 1 inch thick square</li>
  <li>Using a knife or bench scraper, cut dough into 4 pieces. Stack pieces on top of one another, sandwiching any loose dry bits of dough between layers, and press down to flatten. Lift up dough with bench scraper and dust work surface with flour. Roll dough into a 1 inch thick rectangle and trim a thin border around sides of dough to create clean edges. Cut into a 4x3 grid to make 12 biscuits (donâ€™t reroll scraps). Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart; freeze 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter and place in oven. Reduce oven temperaute to 400 C; bake biscuits until deep golden brown, 20-25 minutes.</li>
